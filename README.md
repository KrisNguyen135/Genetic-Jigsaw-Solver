# Solving Jigsaw Puzzles with Genetic Algorithms

# Introduction

# Methodologies

# Future improvements

- Have only the index matrix and the orientation array to represent an individual (omitting the edge arrays), while have a universal edge-array variable somehwere.
- Optimizing the calculation of fitness (maybe use the cluster matrix during)
- Implementing concurrency to improve execution time
- Comparing between using grayscale and not using grayscale
