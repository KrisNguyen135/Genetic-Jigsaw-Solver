# Solving Jigsaw Puzzles with Genetic Algorithms

# Introduction

# Methodologies

# Future improvements

- More thorough analysis on the optimal way to calculate threshold for good matches
- Optimizing the calculation of fitness (maybe use the cluster matrix during)
- Implementing concurrency to improve execution time
- Comparing between using grayscale and not using grayscale
