# Solving Jigsaw Puzzles with a Genetic Algorithm

## Introduction
Jigsaw puzzles are fun! But if you'd like to take the fun out of solving them, it is possible to have computer programs to solve them for you.

While representing images as matrices of pixels, each piece of a jigsaw puzzle is reduced to a 3D matrix. Furthermore, it can be quite easy to find out whether two given pieces (or matrices) can be matched together or not, computationally.

## Methodologies

## Future improvements

- More thorough analysis on the optimal way to calculate threshold for good matches
- Optimizing the calculation of fitness (maybe use the cluster matrix during)
- Implementing concurrency to improve execution time
- Comparing between using grayscale and not using grayscale
